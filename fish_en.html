<h1>BURBOT </h1>
"The body is elongated, low, rounded in the front and strongly compressed from the sides — in the back. The head is flattened, its length exceeds the maximum height of the body. The eye is small. The mouth is large, semi-hollow, the lower jaw is shorter than the upper one. There are small bristle-shaped teeth on the jaws and the head of the coulter, but there are none on the palate. There is one unpaired antennae on the chin (making up 20-30% of the length of the head) and a pair of antennae on the upper jaw.
The color of the burbot's body depends on the nature of the soil, the transparency and illumination of the water, as well as on the age of the fish, so it is quite diverse: more often dark brown or blackish-gray, lightening with age. There are large light spots on the sides of the body and the unpaired fins. The shape and size of the spots may vary. The belly and fins are light[6][9].
There are two dorsal fins: the first of them is short, the second is long. The anal is also long. Together with the second dorsal one, they come close to the caudal one, but do not connect with it. The pectoral fins are rounded. The abdominal muscles are located on the throat.</p>

<h1>COMMON, or EUROPEAN, CATFISH </h1>
"Body length is up to 5 m, weight is up to 400 kg (according to historical data). L. P. Sabaneev cites Kessler's information about the capture of catfish weighing more than 800 kg in the XIX century, in the Dnieper, Dniester and Oder. A catfish weighing 306 kg, over 3 m long and about 80 years old has been officially registered. Now catfish weighing more than 100 kg are extremely rare, nevertheless, cases of catching catfish with a length of more than 2.5 m and a weight of about 150 kg have been reported. The anal fin is long, there is no adipose fin, and the unpaired fins do not have spines.
The color in most cases is brown with shades of brown-green, the belly is white. Depending on the habitat, the color can vary from almost black to light yellow. Sometimes there are albino catfish."
